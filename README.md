## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used variables in CSS for the first time. I also learned how to center the card in the page with top, left, and transform.

```css
:root {
    --dark-cyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
    --cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
    --very-dark-blue: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
    --dark-grayish-blue: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
}

.card__main {
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

I learned how to strikethrough text with HTML.

```html
<strike>$169.99</strike>
```

### Continued development

In the future, I'd like to learn more about positioning with absolute and relative and Flexbox. I'd like to learn how to make text bolder or thicker when font weight doesn't work. I'd also like to learn more about how nested divs work and which div to target for styling.

### Useful resources

- [Css-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This page helped me to understand box shadow-on which side the shadow will show, blur radius, and spread radius.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1891857/how-do-you-stretch-an-image-to-fill-a-div-while-keeping-the-images-aspect-rat) - This question helped me fill a div with an image while keeping the aspect ratio.
